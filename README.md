Transmission lines are vital components of electrical grids, ensuring the efficient transfer
of electricity from power plants to consumers over extensive geographical areas. These
lines are constructed with careful consideration of factors such as conductor materials,
insulation levels, current ratings, and voltage ratings to maintain reliable and safe
electricity delivery. However, various types of faults can occur in transmission lines,
posing significant challenges , often leading to outages, equipment damage, and reduced
system reliability. Accurate and fast fault classification is therefore a pressing
requirement in modern smart grids, where proactive maintenance and resilience are
critical. This research addresses the critical need for an efficient electric fault
classification model. A comprehensive investigation is conducted, employing a variety of
machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF),
Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and,
AdaBoost, for fault classification. Additionally, fundamental ensemble techniques such
as Hard-Voting, Soft-Voting, Stacking, and Blending are incorporated with five hybrid
ML models (each constructed by combining various ML algorithms) to enhance fault
classification performance and the reliability of transmission lines.
